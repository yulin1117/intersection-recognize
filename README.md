Image Processing and Recognition with CNN

This repository contains a set of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for image classification and recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project focuses on augmenting image datasets, splitting images into smaller segments, building classification models, and recognizing objects in images. These scripts are designed to facilitate the process of image preprocessing and model training for various machine learning tasks.

Installation

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git


	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd repo-name


	3.	Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage

Image Augmentation

The aug_main.py script is used for augmenting the dataset by applying various transformations to the images to improve model robustness.

python aug_main.py --input_dir /path/to/images --output_dir /path/to/save/augmented_images

Image Splitting

The split_to_small_img.py script splits large images into smaller patches, useful for tasks where high-resolution images need to be analyzed in smaller parts.

python split_to_small_img.py --input_image /path/to/image --output_dir /path/to/save/splits

Model Training

The classify_image.py script is used to build and train a CNN model for image classification.

python classify_image.py --train_dir /path/to/training/data --epochs 50

Recognition Model

The Recognize_Model.ipynb notebook demonstrates how to apply the trained CNN model to recognize objects in new images.
Simply open the notebook and run the cells to load the trained model and make predictions on the test set.

Project Files

	•	aug_main.py: Script for augmenting image datasets.
	•	split_to_small_img.py: Script for splitting large images into smaller segments.
	•	classify_image.py: Script for building and training a CNN model.
	•	Recognize_Model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for applying the recognition model to classify images.

Results

The trained CNN model achieves high accuracy in image classification tasks, with robust performance after dataset augmentation. The image splitting technique also enhances the precision of object recognition by allowing the model to focus on smaller, detailed segments of the images.
